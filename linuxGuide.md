# Linux Guide

This file will act as an all inclusive guide on how to replicate this project.
Since the project is intended to be replicated on an ipad/iphone I will only
include directions for those devices.

### Authors notes

Due to the current state of this project I do not have a step-by-step
guide on how to recreate this project as it does not work. This may
change in the future. But for now my best advice is to try your hand
at running linux on an old computer or raspberry pi to get a feel for
the os.
