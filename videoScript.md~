Hello, my name is Pat Quintana and my senior engineering capstone
project is a phone that runs linux. During this video I will be
discussing my design process, problems encountered, and more! I hope
you enjoy

## Software

The goal of this project was originally to modify a version of linux
and install it onto a iphone or ipad. The reason behind the project is
my desire to edit and run code on a portable device. Obviously a
computer would be faster, and is somewhat portable however it is
limited. After a couple of hours of research I modified my goals a
bit. I found a few videos and guides on "emulating" linux onto a
iphone using a raspberry pi. I decided to puruse this route due to the
time restrictions. The first time I tried this I ran into an issue
with the SSH key I was using. For those of you who are unfamiliar with
an SSH key its a way to have two devices securily communicate with
each other. I tried a few different operating systems, but the SSH key
continued to be the biggest issue I encountered. I was unable to
resolve this issue and since it was the most critical part of getting
the raspberry pi and iphone to communicate. I tried reconffiguring the
SSH key a few times, but again to no avail. Despite this project not being
succesful I believe is was still a great learning experience. I got to learn
more about SSH keys, different operating systems, and networking. 

## 3D modeling

One of my favorite parts of engineering has been 3d modeling and I wanted
to find a way to incorporate that into my project. So I thought about the
user interaction with the project. Carrying around a raspbery pi in your
pocket isnt the best idea for a multidue of reasons but it's also very
incovienent and uncomfortable. So I made a model and printed a custom case
to carry the raspberry pi and the portable charger that powers it. This was
challenging and a bit time consuming but seeing a succesful print of the
case restored my hope for my project. The current itteration of the case is
a little chunky and will be need to be carried in cargo shorts, but it leaves
me room to improve and redesign to better fit the use case in the future.


## Conclusion

I want to reiterate how much I truly appreciate this
project. Althought it was frustrating and discouraging at times by
perservering through it I feel accomplished despite it not working
properly. All of the missed steps and frustraiting moments taught me
more than if I would've just coasted through this project. Please feel
free to ask me any questions that you may have and if you want to
learn more please feel free to check out my github which details this
whole project.


## Ad

Do you like iphones, do you like open source development? Hi, my name
is Pat Quintana and for my capstone project I attempted to combine
them both into a little something I call a Linux Phone. Using 3d modeling
and shell commands I tried my hand at creation. If this sounds intriguing
come and find me and Ill tell you more!
