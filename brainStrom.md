## Goals
My goal is to run a almost complete version of linux on my iphone.
Althought I would like to have the iphone run linux completely
indepedent due to time restrictions I will use a a raspberry pi
to complete the goal. 
I want it to not have the need for interent access, althought this
maybe unrealistic due to the need for the raspberry pi and iphonbe
to communicate. The main reason for this project is I want a device
that is more portable and convienient to edit my github projects on. 

If I'm unable to use it without internet access it should be realatively
simple to switch between networks and use the device. Althought I have a
laptop which maybe very capable it's more for a proof of concept and less
practicality.

To complete this project in the finite amount of time I have I believe the
user of Linux shells such as iSH and blik will be neccesarry. At first I
belived that this would defeat the purpose of the project however I no longer
believe this to be true. If I'm able to complete the tasks I want to on this
version of my project I believe it meets my own criteria.

## Implementation

The basic implentation and switching of this concept between devices
should be able to be completed in less than 30 minutes. This is due
to my desire to have a plug and play system. Although I believe my
idea of this implementation maybe misguided. It seems more
realistic to mirror the raspberry pi screen onto the phone and use
it as a monitor of sorts for the raspberry pi. This is a more
realistic but not ideal implementation of the concept. I dont
want it to be a remote desktop.
