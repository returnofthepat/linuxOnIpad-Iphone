## Goals
My goal is to run a almost complete version of linux on my iphone.
I would like to be able to use a raspberry pi to do so.
I want it to not have the need for interent access. The reasoning behind
this is to be able to have a portable linux device I can manage my github
projects on.

If I'm unable to use it without internet access it should be realatively
simple to switch between networks and use the device. Althought I have a
laptop which maybe very capable it's more for a proof of concept and less
practicality.

Linux shells using apps such as iSH already exist, however this defeats the
main goal of "running linux" on a iphone. So to be more clear in my definition
I conider running linux to be having a mini computer on my phone. 

## Implementation

The basic implentation and switching of this concept between devices
should be able to be completed in less than 30 minutes. This is due
to my desire to have a plug and play system. Although I believe my
idea of this implementation maybe misguided. It seems more
realistic to mirror the raspberry pi screen onto the phone and use
it as a monitor of sorts for the raspberry pi. This is a more
realistic but not ideal implementation of the concept. I dont
want it to be a remote desktop. Do i even know what I want it
to be??
