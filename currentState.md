# Current State

## SSH Key issues

The current state of this project is incomplete. Although I wanted to
complete this project by 23-04-2024 I was unable to do so. This is due
to my minimal knowledge of networking and the time restrictions placed
on this project. I have flashed 3 different operating systems, I was
unable to get any of these to work. Upon completing the initilization
of the ssh key I attempted to connect the Iphone to the raspberry pi;
but I was unable to do so. I attempted to refresh my memory on SSH key
basics to resolve this issue without success.

## Next steps

### Ideal approach

The ideal approach to solve this issue is to proceed with my original
plan. I want to rework a 32-bit version of linux to be installed
directly onto the iphone without the need for a raspberry pu or other
decie to helpo emmulate linux onto the raspberry pi. This would
entail a lot more work but i belive it would be advantageous not
only for myself but for others who want to run linux on their iphone.
I would want to be able to dual boot iphone - os and linux onto the phone
so that the usability of the device would not be limited. Alternatively
finding a way to make a linux os for a phone would be increadibly
intersting and useful. This would mean that the phone would be able to
function as exactly that but also have the benefits on a laptop. So you
could make calls, work in the terminal, text, play games, etc. 

### Realistic approach

I believe a realistic approach to this would be understanding exactly
what went wrong with the SSH key. I belive that the setup would be
fairly simple after getting through the SSH key issue. Nothing else
to detail here, I just need more time to have a realistic approach
to solving this issue.
