## SSH Key issues

Upon completing the initilization of the ssh key I attempted to connect
the Iphone to the raspberry pi; but I'm currently unable to do so. I
believe I need to refresh my memory on SSH key basics to resolve this
issue. When prompted for a password to access the ssh key I entered
the password to the raspberry pi. After 10 failed attempts I reset the
password on the raspberry pi, but this did not result in progress. So
I removed the password prompt from the ssh key(despite the lowered
security). I was still unable to connect to the ssh key. I believe I
may need to reflash the raspberry pi to make a new ssh; this may not
be the case but this is the quickest route I see working. I tried
accessing the ssh key from another device to no avail
